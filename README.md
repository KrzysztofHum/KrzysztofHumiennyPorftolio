# Krzysztof Humienny Portfolio

A react news app utilising GatsbyJs hosted on netlify. https://krzysztofhumienny.netlify.app/

## About the build

Besides enjoying the content, I found the Gatsby extensive documentation and support a great resource to use for this project. The idea was to create a quick page where I will post my projects. The website is mainly used to show my skills during recruitment.

## Functionality

###### Sections

There are presented my projects and information about me. You can clik and ,,About me" to see information about me. Below the project photo there are links to the code and the live projet.

###### Misc

Clicking on the icon redirects you to my profile on linkedin and github. After click on hamburger menu you can download my CV and write email to me.

## Style

For styling i used SASS, that was my first time when i used this preprocessor scripting language.
